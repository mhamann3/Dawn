<h2><b>BREAD CARE TIPS &amp; TRICKS<br></b></h2>
<p><b>Q: Where should I store my PACHA bread?<br></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PACHA bread doesn't have any preservatives, so we recommend getting it to the freezer as soon as it arrives or comes home from the store. Once you are ready to eat, you can thaw it and store in the fridge, where it will last for 1-2 weeks. You can also slice, freeze, and toast it directly from the freezer. Like all bread, PACHA is best enjoyed toasted!!<br></span></p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the shelf life of my bread?</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">PACHA bread will last 1-2 weeks in your refrigerator. We recommend that you store it in the freezer until you're ready to use it so that it lasts much longer (1-2 years!). Check out the date on the "If Frozen, Best By:" sticker on the outside of your box. NOTE: This sticker indicates the <em>FROZEN</em> shelf life.<br></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: Since I had to cut open the vacuum-seal bag, do I need to put my loaf into something air-tight?</strong></p>
<p>Not necessarily. We do recommend keeping the end of your vacuum bag closed (you can tuck it under your loaf or use a rubber band) but it doesn't need to be fully airtight. In fact, because our loaves are more dense and moist than a typical glutenous bread, if the loaves dries out just a bit it can help prevent mold from growing. If you feel like it's getting dry and crumbly, it might be time to bust out the Tupperware. üòú</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Q: I got my bread in the frozen section. What do I do now?</strong><br></span></p>
<p>The first step is to thaw. If you're jonesing for your PACHA fix RIGHT NOW, you can thaw it on the defrost setting on your microwave. You can also set your loaf on the counter, or even in the sun or a warm water bath (before you open the vacuum seal!). You'll want to keep your loaf refrigerated once it's thawed out!</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I keep my bread in the freezer?</strong></p>
<p>Definitely. You can store whole, unopened loaves that you're not ready to eat for 2 years. If you just don't go through your bread very quickly, <span style="font-weight: 400;">you can slice a thawed loaf before re-freezing and toast the slices one at a time out of the ice box.<strong> </strong>You'll want to use a freezer-safe container or bag for this method.<br></span></p>
<p><b>Q: What's the best way to slice my PACHA?<br></b></p>
<p>Oh boy, do we have some tips for you! ‚òùüèº</p>
<p>1. PACHA bread is easiest to slice when it's nice and chilled.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> A <b>sharp, non-serrated knife</b> like a chef's knife works best, but a serrated bread knife also does the job (and is better than a dull knife).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. We leave the slice thickness up to you. If you want a crispier bite that toasts faster, try a slice 1/2 cm think. If you want soft inside, crispy outside, try 1cm thick.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. We also leave the slice SHAPE up to you! If you want a larger, sandwich-sized bread slice, <a href="https://livepacha.com/blogs/news/the-sandwich-slice" title="Sandwich Slice">try this sandwich slice technique</a>! You'll need at least half a loaf to achieve these sandwich squares.</span></p>

<p><b>Q: How much does shipping cost?</b></p>
<p>We ship from our facility in San Diego using UPS Ground Shipping or FedEx 2-day shipping -- whichever method will get your bread to you within 2 days of leaving our hands.
